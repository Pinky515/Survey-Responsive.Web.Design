# About this Repository

This is the first project I created using [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org)'s Responsive Web Design curriculum.

I got to play around with some features like:

- linear gradients as a background color
- box shadows around my submit button
- using characters to create emojis

**Placeholders** and a variety of **input** types give the form an official look.

The site doesn't have any functionality on purpose.
